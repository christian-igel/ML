# Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis

This section of the exam considers the task of automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.
The data are a subset of the data analyzed by Sørensen et al. (2016, 2017), and we refer to these two studies for further background information.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disease. The vast majority of AD diagnoses are uncertain. Often, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is part of the diagnosis, but only to rule out other causes of the symptoms. However, our work suggests that MRI scans carry much more quantitative and diagnostic information.

A system developed by DIKU and the DIKU spin-off company Biomediq can separate cognitively normal, dementia, and pre-dementia patients with high accuracy when incorporating MRI data, as demonstrated by winning   the MICCAI CADDementia Grand Challenge in 2014 (Sørensen et al., 2016, 2017).

The data in this repository are subsets of the data used by Sørensen et al. and are preprocessed in a similar way. *The system developed by Sørensen et al. distinguished between three classes: healthy, mildly cognitively impaired, and AD. However, the data sets contain only examples for healthy and AD.*
