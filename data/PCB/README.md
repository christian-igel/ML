# PCB in Fish


The file `PCB.dt` contains the concentrations of polychlorinated
biphenyl (PCB) residues in lake trouts from the Cayuga Lake, NY, as
reported by Bach et al. (1972).  `The ages of the fish
were accurately known, because the fish are annually stocked as
yearlings and distinctly marked as to year class. Each whole fish was
mechanically chopped, ground, and thoroughly mixed, and 5-gram samples
taken. The samples were treated and PCB residues in parts per million
(ppm) were estimated using column chromatography'
(Bates and Watts, 1988).

Each line in `PCB.dt` is one training pattern.  The first
number is the age of the fish in years and the
second is the corresponding PCB
concentration (in ppm).
